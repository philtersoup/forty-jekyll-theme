An exploration in creating a **responsive environment** to enable audience interaction.  The audience and the environment react to and from each other, creating sonic and visual discourse, centered around **feedback**:
<br>
<br>
*“The responsive environment has been presented as the basis for a new aesthetic medium based on real-time interaction between men and machines. A physical space in which a computer perceives the actions of those who enter and responds intelligently through complex visual and auditory displays. For the artist, the environment augurs’ new relationships with his audience and his art. He operates at a meta level. The participant provides the direct performance of the experience. The environmental hardware is the instrument. The computer acts much as an orchestra conductor controlling the broad relationships while the artist provides the score to which both performer and conductor are bound”* (Krueger, 1977)

This installation fused my personal interests: **generative composition, audio-video synthesis, physical computing and networked interaction design** into an installation. Being a big fan of synergy, it was a personal goal to have the various elements intertwine and create an experience that was bigger than the sum of parts.

Bespoke hardware and software solutions were created by fusing contemporary techniques of sound and visual manipulation with web-technologies to imbibe audience participation and interaction.

![System Overview](/assets/images/Aesthesis_Overview_Main.png){:class="image-fit"}

A **node.js** server was the backbone of this installation, parsing information from mobile audience interaction developed in **p5.js**, and relaying it to 3 stations. Each of these stations further controlled different aspects of the installation.

A modular synthesizer was used for sound design and utilised a quadrophonic speaker array to create a sense of depth and movement. The soundscape generated was aleotoric in nature with scope for human intervention, shaping the rate and depth of musical evolution. Audience members had macro control over the sound and the system converted this bulk interaction data from up-to 16 individuals into perceivable changes, which in turn affected the visual content.

Paying homage to the works of <a href="https://bit.ly/2J7sUO6"> John Whitney </a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/2J9toDy"> Nam June Paik </a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/2diZ4HT"> Roy Ascott </a>, Aesthesis aimed at creating a synesthetic visual environment using analog video synthesis at its heart through the medium of CRT Televisions and high-luminosity projectors. Retro-futuristic shapes and patterns generated by an analog video synthesizer, designed by <a href="http://gieskes.nl/"> Gijs Gieskes </a> was combined with GLSL shaders designed in Cycling 74 Max and mixed through a custom designed *Voltage Controlled Video Matrix*.
