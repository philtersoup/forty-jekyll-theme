Aesthesis was an exploration in creating a **responsive environment** enabling audience interaction.  The audience and the environment react to and from each other, creating sonic and visual discourse, centered around **feedback**:
“The responsive environment has been presented as the basis for a new aesthetic medium based on real-time interaction between men and machines. A physical space in which a computer perceives the actions of those who enter and responds intelligently through complex visual and auditory displays. For the artist, the environment augurs’ new relationships with his audience and his art. He operates at a meta level. The participant provides the direct performance of the experience. The environmental hardware is the instrument. The computer acts much as an orchestra conductor controlling the broad relationships while the artist provides the score to which both performer and conductor are bound” (Krueger, 1977)
Autonomous composition of a soundscape is affected by audience interaction, and the composition further influences synesthetic visuals, generated in real-time. The project aims to explore methods of interfacing technology and ideas from digital and analog domain and, to design a unified system that is hybrid; allowing digital control over analog sources.
